<h1 id="version-1-0-0">version 1.0.0</h1>
<p>Initial release. The following features are included in this release:</p>
<ol>
<li>The plugin will convert a simple HTML file input to an advanced file picker control. Will help fallback to a file input for browsers not supporting JQuery or Javascript.</li>
<li>The file input consists of the following three sections with options and templates to control the display:<ul>
<li>file caption section: to display a brief information of the file(s) selected</li>
<li>file action buttons section: to browse, remove, and upload files.</li>
<li>file preview section: to display the selected files on client for preview (supports images and text file types). Other file types will be displayed as normal thumbnails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The plugin automatically converts an input with <code>type = file</code> to an advanced file picker input if you set its <code>class = file</code>. All options to the input can be passed as HTML5 <code>data</code> attributes.</li>
<li>Ability to select and preview multiple files. Uses HTML 5 File reader API to read and preview files. Displays the progress of files being being loaded onto the preview zone, in case many files are chosen.</li>
<li>Offers predefined templates and CSS classes which can be changed to style your file-input display as per your needs.</li>

<li>caption section</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Customise the location of the target container elements to display the entire plugin, the caption container, the caption text, the preview container, preview image, and preview status.</li>

<li>Customise the messages for preview, progress, and files selected.</li>
